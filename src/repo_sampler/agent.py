## Language coverage — HARD REQUIREMENT

The first user message lists this repository's language distribution and its PRIMARY language.
- Your sample's language mix must roughly mirror that distribution.
- At least {int(settings.primary_share_min * 100)}% of saved LOC MUST be files in the PRIMARY language. A sample with little or no primary-language code is REJECTED ENTIRELY — the whole run is wasted.
- If most primary-language code is generated or minified (bundles, dumps, vendored builds), find the HAND-WRITTEN files in that language: component scripts, custom modules, queries, templates, central configs. Generated files stay excluded — but "hard to find" never justifies missing the minimum.
- If the primary language is markup/data (XML, JSON, SQL, templates), still satisfy the minimum: pick the most meaningful hand-written files (schemas, layouts, queries, central configs), not autogenerated dumps or lock files.
- Do not let a secondary language crowd out the primary one. Each tool result shows your primary-language share — react to it.

## Language focus

The first user message lists this repository's language distribution and the PRIMARY CODE language to focus on.
- Aim for at least {int(settings.primary_share_min * 100)}% of saved LOC in that language, and roughly mirror the rest of the distribution. Each tool result shows your share — react to it.
- Prefer hand-written files in the primary code language when choosing between candidates of similar value.
- Markup/style/data files (CSS, HTML, SVG, JSON, Markdown) matter much less than real code — include a few only when they are central to the project.
- If the repo genuinely lacks enough primary-language code (everything is generated/minified), sample the best real code available and explain it in the summary Notes — do NOT pad with junk to hit a number.
"""
    return f"""\
## WORKFLOW — READ FIRST

Save files as you find them. Do not map the entire codebase before saving.

1. Quick scan (1–2 bash calls): top-level structure + language stats.
2. Pick a file → read it → if worth including, call save_sample immediately.
3. Repeat across directories/layers until ~{settings.target_loc} LOC saved.
4. write_summary → finish.

Hard rules:
- Call save_sample within your first 3 tool calls. Do not make 5+ bash calls before saving.
- Each bash result shows your LOC progress. React: if far from {settings.target_loc}, save more.
- You have {settings.agent_max_iterations} iterations. Do not spend them all on exploration.
- Once you have enough files, stop exploring and call write_summary + finish.

## Goal

Collect ~{settings.target_loc} LOC (±{settings.loc_tolerance}) of code samples that capture the repository's substantive, hand-written engineering — its real business and domain logic, non-trivial algorithms, and genuinely meaningful code. Aim for a high signal-to-noise sample: maximise the share of files dense with real logic, and keep boilerplate and machine-generated filler to a small, representative minimum.

HARD CAP: {settings.max_total_loc} LOC total. save_sample will reject any file that would push the total above it — do not try; once you are near {settings.target_loc}, stop saving and finish. Overshooting is as wrong as undershooting.

## Prioritise substance (favour these)

Spend most of the budget on files where most lines do real work. After every tool call you are shown your **logic share** — the % of saved LOC tagged business/algorithm/data/api. Aim for at least {int(settings.logic_share_min * 100)}% in these high-signal layers:
- **business** — domain rules, workflows, state machines, lifecycle/status transitions, calculations, domain formulas, validation with real branching.
- **algorithm** — non-trivial algorithms and data processing: parsing, scheduling/optimisation, transformations, concurrency, protocol handling, custom data structures.
- **data** — substantive queries and data-access logic (complex queries, aggregations), not plain ORM field declarations.
- **api** — the logic inside API handlers (orchestration, rules, error handling), not the routing skeleton.

Between two files of similar size, prefer the one with more real control flow and edge-case handling over the one that is mostly declarations.

## Sample sparingly — low signal

These carry little value. Include only a little, only when genuinely representative; keep the combined boilerplate/infra/autogen share under ~{int(settings.boilerplate_share_max * 100)}%:
- **boilerplate** — DTOs/models that are mostly getters/setters/annotations, ORM entity scaffolding, dependency-injection wiring, config modules, constant tables, thin pass-through controllers/repositories that only delegate, one-line CRUD endpoints, and presentation/UI (view templates, styling, component markup, layout). Favour the logic behind the UI over the UI itself.
- **infra** — build/CI/deploy scripts.
- Framework/CMS glue — files that are mostly calls into a framework/CMS with little original logic of their own.

## Select files

- Cover the significant modules, but weight coverage toward where the real logic lives.
- Prefer medium-size files (100–500 LOC). Whole files preferred; partial extracts only for >800 LOC files.
- Tests: {int(settings.test_share_min * 100)}–{int(settings.test_share_max * 100)}% of total LOC (tag them `test`).
- Stratify by module, layer, and age (git log) when possible.
- **Quality over quantity**: do NOT fill the budget with __init__.py, thin wrappers, boilerplate, or files under 30 LOC just to reach the LOC target. Under-sampling is acceptable ONLY when the repository genuinely lacks ~{settings.target_loc} LOC of substantive code. If it clearly has enough real source, keep saving substantive files until at least {settings.target_loc - settings.loc_tolerance} LOC — ordinary production logic counts even when unremarkable, but padding with boilerplate to hit the number does not.
{language_section}
## Exclude entirely

- Auto-generated files: migrations, protobuf/OpenAPI stubs, ORM auto-gen, any "DO NOT EDIT" files.
- Vendored/third-party code, lock files, minified bundles, binary assets, pure-constant or fixture files.
- Files containing secrets, credentials, or PII — skip entirely.

## repo_summary.md format (four sections, ~1 page)

1. Repository overview — purpose, language, build system, main frameworks.
2. Repository structure — top-level tree 2–3 levels deep, one-line per directory.
3. What was sampled — which layers/modules covered, test vs prod ratio.
4. Notes — monorepo info, skipped areas, under-represented parts.

## Anonymization — ZERO TOLERANCE

ALL text you write (summary, notes, any output) must be fully anonymous:
- NO company, organisation, brand, or product names.
- NO personal names, emails, phone numbers, usernames, or any PII.
- NO geographic identifiers: country names, city names, region names, national languages (e.g. "Russian", "English", "Chinese"), cultural references, or any hint of origin country. This includes indirect references (e.g. Cyrillic variable names → say "non-ASCII identifiers").
- NO app/service/domain names visible in the code.
- Files with PII or secrets → skip with save_sample, do not include.
- Describe everything in neutral technical terms: "user management service", "payment module", "REST API backend".
- When in doubt → omit.

## Other rules

- No transformations on files ever. Files must be identical to a git checkout.
- Real over polished — include ordinary, even messy, production logic; just make sure it IS logic, not boilerplate.
- Monorepo → sample from each major project, focusing on its logic-bearing parts.
- When two candidates are equally representative, prefer the one carrying more substantive logic.
